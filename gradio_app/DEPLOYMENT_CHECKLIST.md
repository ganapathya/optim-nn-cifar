## 🎯 Deployment Steps (Quick Reference)

### Method 1: Web UI Upload (Recommended)

1. **Create Space**

   - Go to: https://huggingface.co/new-space
   - Name: `cifar100-resnet18-classifier`
   - SDK: Gradio
   - License: MIT

2. **Upload Files**
   Upload these files from `gradio_app/` folder:

   - ✅ `app.py`
   - ✅ `requirements.txt`
   - ✅ `best_model.pth`
   - ✅ `cifar100/` (entire folder)
   - ✅ `README_HF.md` → rename to `README.md`

3. **Wait for Build** (~2-3 minutes)

4. **Test Your App!**
   - URL: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/SPACE_NAME`

## 🧪 Pre-Deployment Tests

### Test Locally First (Recommended)

```bash
cd gradio_app
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:7860 and verify:

- ✅ App loads without errors
- ✅ Image upload works
- ✅ Predictions display correctly
- ✅ Top-5 results show with confidence scores
- ✅ Class names formatted nicely

### Expected Behavior

1. **Upload Image** → Image preview appears
2. **Processing** → Takes ~0.5-1 second
3. **Results** → Top 5 predictions with percentages
4. **No Errors** → Clean interface, no console errors

- Comprehensive documentation below

### Example Predictions

```
Upload: cat.jpg
Results:
1. Cat: 87.3%
2. Tiger: 5.2%
3. Leopard: 3.1%
4. Lion: 2.4%
5. Fox: 1.0%
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### requirements.txt

```
torch>=2.0.0
torchvision>=0.15.0
gradio>=4.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
albumentations>=1.3.0
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0
pillow>=10.0.0
```

### Model Path

```python
MODEL_PATH = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'best_model.pth')
```

### CIFAR-100 Classes

- 100 total classes
- Animals, vehicles, nature, household items, food, etc.
- Full list in README_HF.md

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **README.md Name**

   - Upload `README_HF.md` as `README.md` on Huggingface
   - This displays documentation on your Space

2. **Model File Size**

   - 86 MB - within Huggingface limits
   - Will be tracked with Git LFS automatically
   - Upload may take 1-2 minutes

3. **Build Time**

   - First build: 2-3 minutes
   - Installing PyTorch takes most time
   - Watch build logs for any errors

4. **Hardware**
   - Free CPU Basic tier is sufficient
   - Inference time: ~10-20ms per image
   - Can upgrade if needed

## ✅ Final Verification

Before deploying, confirm:

- [x] All files present in `gradio_app/` folder
- [x] `best_model.pth` is 86 MB
- [x] `app.py` updated for Huggingface Spaces
- [x] `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- [x] `cifar100/` module has all .py files
- [x] Tested locally (optional but recommended)
- [x] README prepared (README_HF.md)
