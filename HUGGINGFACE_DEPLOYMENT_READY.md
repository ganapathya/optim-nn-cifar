## 🚀 Quick Deployment Guide

### Option 1: Web UI Upload (Easiest - 5 minutes)

**Step 1:** Go to https://huggingface.co/new-space

**Step 2:** Create Space

- Name: `cifar100-resnet18-classifier`
- SDK: Gradio
- License: MIT
- Click "Create Space"

**Step 3:** Upload Files

Click **"Files" → "Add file" → "Upload files"**

Upload from `gradio_app/` folder:

1. `app.py`
2. `best_model.pth` (86MB - may take 1-2 min)
3. `requirements.txt`
4. `cifar100/` folder (select all .py files inside)
5. `README_HF.md` → **rename to `README.md`** when uploading

**Step 4:** Wait for Build (~2-3 minutes)

Watch the build logs at the top of your Space page.

**Step 5:** Done! 🎉

Your app will be live at:

```
https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/cifar100-resnet18-classifier
```

---

### Option 2: Git Push (Advanced)

See detailed instructions in `gradio_app/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

---

## 🧪 Test Before Deploying (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
cd gradio_app
python app.py
```

Open http://localhost:7860 and verify:

- ✅ App loads
- ✅ Upload works
- ✅ Predictions accurate
- ✅ No errors
